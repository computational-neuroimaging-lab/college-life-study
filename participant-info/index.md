# Scheduling
After completing the [study screener](https://redcap.prc.utexas.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=9EWH9CFJDH), eligible participants will receive an email from 'College Life Study Registration' (utexas-collegelife-admin@sona-systems.net). This email will include your login information and a link to the Sona Systems registration site. After logging in, you will have the ability to change your password or modify your contact information. To register, click 'View Available Studies' on the main page, and follow instructions to schedule both of your study visits. After registering you will have the option to directly email the researcher that will host your study visit.

# Visit 1 (V1)
## Directions
Your first study visit will be at the [Health Discovery Building (HDB)](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/maps) at Dell Medical School (1701 Trinity St., Austin, TX ). HDB is less than half a mile from Jester Residence Hall, so walking or scooting will be a viable option for most students, weather permitting. 

If you're coming from West Campus, the [642 West Campus](https://www.capmetro.org/schedmap/?svc=3&f1=642&s=0&d=K) (Stop Name: 2001 San Jacinto & 20th) or [640 Forty Acres](https://www.capmetro.org/schedmap/?svc=3&f1=640&s=0&d=E) (Stop Name: 112 Martin Luther Kind Jr & Congress) Cap Metro routes may be a good option to get you within a closer walking distance to HDB.

Routes 7 and 10 both offer quick rides from campus along San Jacinto down to 17th street (Stop Name: San Jacinto & 17th), just 1 block from HDB. 

If you'd like to drive, paid parking is available in the [Health Center Garage](https://parking.utexas.edu/parking/garages/health-center-garage-hcg), and at parking meters on or near Trinity Street. We are not responsible for parking violations and we will not reimburse you for parking fees.

## Arrival
We recommend arriving 10 minutes prior to your scheduled visit time to avoid delays. There is a security desk in the lobby of HDB. Let them know you are here for a research study on the first floor. A member of the research staff will meet you in the lobby and walk you to the assessment room.

## Departure
The Northbound metro routes 7 and 10 both stop directly in front of HDB, and are a quick way to return to main campus.

# Visit 2 (V2)
## 8-hour fast
We are requesting that you refrain from eating or drinking any food or beverage other than water for 8 hours prior to your scheduled V2 visit. This is so that all of the bio-markers in your blood and saliva are collected at baseline, and not influenced by your recent diet. You'll have a chance to eat after the blood and saliva collection, before continuing with the rest of the study visit. 

## At-home saliva preparation (morning of V2)
At the end of V1, we gave you a tube for saliva collection. We'd like you to self-administer your saliva collection at home the morning of V2. Here are some important reminders:

- collect saliva immediately after you wake up (before brushing teeth, showering, etc.) 
- avoid eating or drinking before sample collection

See below for a video demonstration:

alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="600" height="450" allowfullscreen border="10" /></a></p>


After collecting the saliva, please use the materials we've given you to keep the saliva refrigerated up to the moment you hand it to the lab tech. You can use your refrigerator at home, and ice to keep it cold during transport to the lab. 

## Saliva drop-off and blood draw (Health and Integrative Physiology Lab)
Your first appointment for V2 will be scheduled at the Health and Integrative Physiology Lab (HIPL). This is where you will bring your saliva tube and have your blood drawn. 

### Driving
If you plan to drive, please contact Mike Dial (michael.dial@utexas.edu) at least 48-hours before your visit so that he can reserve a parking pass. On the day of, you may park in one of the F84 parking spaces at the stadium near the parking kiosk.  When you arrive, text or call Mike (801-891-5699)(weekdays only!) so that he can bring your parking pass to you and escort you up to the lab.

### Walking
If you are walking or biking, enter Bellmont Hall from the San Jancinto side. Enter the doors next to the UT apparel store and take the lobby elevators up to the 8th floor. The lab is just down the hallway through the door marked 822.

### Weekend Visits (Saturday, Sunday and Labor Day)
On weekends, doors to Bellmont are locked. However, we have given limited UT ID Card access for participants scheduled on weekends. If you have trouble getting in, call Drew Gourley (225-571-6971)(weekends/holiday only!), and he will meet you at the entrance to let you in.

## Health Discovery Building (HDB)
After your blood and saliva collection, you will head to HDB for the rest of your assessments and MRI scan. HDB is about 1/2 mile south of the stadium down Trinity Street. You will again arrive at the 1st floor lobby of HDB where research staff will meet you.

## Breakfast
Before beginning your assessments, we will provide breakfast and a short break before continuing the study.

## MRI Scan
Before entering the MRI environment, you will be asked to change into medical scrubs (provided) and remove all metal from your body, hair and clothing. Please plan accordingly and dress in comfortable clothing with no metal and avoid hair products, accessories, glittery nail polish and jewelry if possible. We will give you a print out of your MRI as a souvenir.

# At-home tasks
In the 3-4 week period after your first visit (V1) and before your second visit (V2), you will be asked to complete a series of at-home tasks. These tasks are *just as important* as the tasks you complete during your lab visits. Our goal is to make participating as convenient as possible and minimize the time you spend in our lab. You will be compensated for these tasks when you return for V2. 

*If these tasks are not completed by your V2, we reserve the right to cancel V2 and withdraw you from the study.*

## Home Surveys
After V1, we will email you a link to your unique survey queue. We ask that you work on these in a setting where you can read carefully and pay close attention to the questions (such as your dorm room, library or study area). The surveys do not have to be completed in one sitting; You can use this link at any time to see which surveys remain. 

## Dietary Assessment
After V1, we will also email a unique username and password to the ASA24 website. This is where you will complete 3 dietary reports before returning for V2. 

## Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)(Beiwe app)
In V1 we will assist you with downloading the smartphone app, [Beiwe](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/beiwe-research-platform/). EMA is a method of data collection that tries to capture peoplesâ€™ behaviors and experiences in real time in their natural environments. After your V1, your phone will prompt you each day to answer several questions about your daily activities and behaviors. 

In addition to pushing these surveys, the Beiwe application passively collects phone data from your phone's sensors and radios. It CANNOT access the content of your messages, calls or websites/apps visited, microphone, camera nor can it identify anyone you interact with.

# Off-season 
After completing V2, we will keep your contact information and plan for a follow-up visit around 6 months later. We'll contact you closer to that time with details. We ask that you please notify us if you leave the university, or encounter any circumstances that would prevent you from continuing with the study. Otherwise, we will plan to repeat the process.
