# Saliva Collection

## Why are we collecting saliva?

## Instructions for self-administering at home

At the end of your V1 visit, we will provide you with a tube for saliva collection. We will also go over the instructions on how to self-administer your saliva collection at home. Here are some important reminders:

- collect saliva immediately after you wake up (before brushing teeth) 
- avoid eating or drinking before sample collection
