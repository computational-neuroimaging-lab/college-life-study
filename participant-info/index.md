# Visit 1 (V1)
## Directions
Your first study visit will be at the Health Discovery Building (HDB) at Dell Medical School (1701 Trinity St., Austin, TX https://dellmed.utexas.edu/maps). HDB is less than half a mile from Jester Residence Hall, so walking or scooting will be a viable option for many students, weather permitting. 

If you're on West Campus, the 640 Forty Acres route via Cap Metro (https://www.capmetro.org/schedmap/?svc=3&f1=640&s=0&d=E) may be a good option for you. Stop 5992 at MLK and Congress is a .3 mile walk to HDB. Otherwise, routes 7 and 10 are both good options to travel from North Campus along San Jacinto down to 17th street. 

If you'd like to drive, parking is available in the Health Center Garage (https://parking.utexas.edu/parking/garages/health-center-garage-hcg), and at parking meters on or near Trinity Street.

## Arrival
We recommend arriving 10 minutes prior to your scheduled visit time to avoid delays. There is a security desk in the lobby of HDB. Let them know you are here for a research study on the first floor. A member of the research staff will meet you in the lobby and walk you to the assessment room.

## Departure
The Northbound metro routes 7 and 10 both stop directly in front of HDB, and are a good way to return to main campus. Make sure to exit before Dean Keeton, or you will leave campus!

# At-Home Tasks
## Surveys
After your first visit (V1) and before your second visit (V2), you are tasked with completing a series of online surveys. We will email you a link to your unique survey queue at the end of V1. Although our goal is to make this easy and convenient for you, we ask that you work on these in a setting where you can read carefully and pay close attention to the questions (such as your dorm room, library or study area). The surveys do not have to be completed in one sitting; You can use this link at any time to see which surveys remain. You will be compensated for completing these when you return for your second visit (V2).

## Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method of data collection that tries to capture peoplesâ€™ behaviors and experiences in real time in their natural environments. We will be using the smartphone app, [Beiwe](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/beiwe-research-platform/), to track some real-world wellness behaviors. Each day, your phone will prompt you to answer several questions about your day. These are intended to capture your thoughts, attitudes and behaviors in real-time throughout your daily life. 

In addition to pushing these surveys, the Beiwe application passively collects phone data from your phone's sensors and radios. It CANNOT observe the content of your messages, calls or websites/apps visited, nor can it identify anyone you interact with.

# Visit 2 (V2)
## 8-hour fast
We are requesting that you refrain from eating or drinking any food or beverage other than water for 8 hours prior to your scheduled V2 visit. This is so that all of the bio-markers in your blood and saliva are collected at a baseline level, and not influenced by your recent diet. Don't worry, you'll have a chance to eat after the blood and saliva collection, before continuing with the rest of the study visit. 

## At-home saliva preparation (morning of V2)
At the end of V1, we gave you a tube for saliva collection. We'd like you to self-administer your saliva collection at home the morning of V2. Here are some important reminders:

- collect saliva immediately after you wake up (before brushing teeth) 
- avoid eating or drinking before sample collection

See below for a video demonstration:

After collecting the saliva, please use the materials we've given you to keep the saliva refrigerated up to the moment you hand it to the lab tech. You can use your refrigerator at home, and ice to keep it cold during transport to the lab. 


## Saliva drop-off and Blood Draw (Health and Integrative Physiology Lab)
Your first appointment for V2 will be scheduled at the Health and Integrative Physiology Lab. This is where you will bring your saliva tube and have your blood drawn. Please visit their website for contact information and directions to the facility (https://sites.edb.utexas.edu/hipl/contact/).

Please keep in mind that this lab is separate from the study's research team at Dell Medical School. You may contact them with questions about the blood draw, saliva drop-off, or facility, but they do not have information regarding the rest of the study.

## Health Discovery Building (HDB)
After your blood and saliva collection, you will head to HDB for the rest of your assessments and MRI scan. HDB is about 1/2 mile south of the stadium down Trinity Street. You will again arrive at the 1st floor lobby of HDB where research staff will meet you.


## Breakfast
Before beginning your assessments, we will provide you with $10 cash and a 15-minute break for breakfast. The Nourish Cafe is located in the Health Transformation Building which is connected to HDB. (http://flikcafes.compass-usa.com/nourishcafe/Pages/Home.aspx?lid=b1) After breakfast, meet us back in the HDB lobby to continue with V2.
