# Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a method of data collection that tries to capture peoplesâ€™ behaviors and experiences in real time in their natural environments. We will be using the smartphone app, [Beiwe](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/beiwe-research-platform/), to track some real-world wellness behaviors. Each day, your phone will prompt you to answer several questions about your day. 

# Saliva Collection

## Why are we collecting saliva?


## Instructions for self-administering at home

At the end of your V1 visit, we will provide you with a tube for saliva collection. We will also go over the instructions on how to self-administer your saliva collection at home. Here are some important reminders:

- collect saliva immediately after you wake up (before brushing teeth) 
- avoid eating or drinking before sample collection

See below for a video demonstration:
