# Introduction

The overall goal of the **College Life Brain Study** is to increase our understanding of how lifestyle factors (for example, physical activity, sleep patterns, substance use, etc.) affect brain development during the critical period of [emerging adulthood](http://jeffreyarnett.com/ARNETT_Emerging_Adulthood_theory.pdf). This is a 4-year study that involves visiting our laboratory 3 times a year (2 assessment visits and a brief check-in visit). This study is open to freshmen students (ages 18-19) at The University of Texas at Austin. The study has been reviewed and approved by the UT Institutional Review Board (IRB study number: 2018-11-0061).

Each year, we will be conducting a comprehensive assessment of your physical health, mental and emotional health, substance use, social factors, and neurocognitive function. These assessments provide a rich dataset for us to learn about different changes that occur throughout college. We ensure that all data will be kept confidential and stored in a secure and encrypted server.

# Study locations
Study visits will occur at:
- Health Discovery Building (HDB) at Dell Medical School ([1701 Trinity St., Austin, TX 78712](https://goo.gl/maps/maEBpgS8xH12)).
- [Health and Integrative Physiology Lab](https://sites.edb.utexas.edu/hipl/contact/), Bellmont Hall Room 804/816/822A ([2109 San Jacinto Blvd. Austin, TX 78712](https://goo.gl/maps/kaHbZX8aHm22))

# What will you be asked to do?

If you wish to be in this study, you will first complete a [brief online screener](https://redcap.prc.utexas.edu/redcap/surveys/?s=9EWH9CFJDH) to make sure you are eligible to participate. If you are eligible, you will schedule 2 study visits. After your 2 study visits, we will give you a list of at-home assessments to complete within a 3-week period ([See details here](http://collegelife.utbrainstudy.org/participant-info/#at-home-tasks)). They should take no more than 3 hours to complete. During this 3-week period, we will also ask you to partake in daily questionnaires using a smartphone app ([Beiwe](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/beiwe-research-platform/)).

## V1 visits
The first study visit (V1) takes about 2.5 hours. During your very first V1 visit, we will explain the procedures of the research study in depth. If you agree to continue, you will take part in interviews and surveys about your medical history, mental and emotional health, substance use, and academic performance. Additionally, you will complete a brief sensory assessment (vision, hearing, and smell).

## V2 visits
The second study visit (V2) takes about 4 hours to complete and will occur in the morning (around 8 am). On the morning of your V2 visit, we will ask you to provide a saliva sample immediately after waking up ([See details here](http://computational-neuroimaging-lab.org/college-life-study/participant-info/#saliva-collection)). We will provide you a saliva collection tube during your V1 visit. The purpose for the saliva samples is to assess cortisol levels, a hormone related to stress. We will also collect 2-3 strands of hair, approximately 3 cm in length. The hair samples provide a longer term analysis of chronic stress levels, whereas the saliva samples show your stress levels around the time of collection.

Additionally, we will ask you to fast overnight 8 hours before coming in for your visit (breakfast will be provided). The purpose of fasting is to ensure accurate assessment of your metabolic health. You will begin your V2 visit at the Health and Integrative Physiology Lab where Dr. Michelle Harrison will perform a blood draw ([See details here](http://computational-neuroimaging-lab.org/college-life-study/participant-info/#blood-collection)). When you first arrive at our facility, we will collect your saliva sample and store it in a secured freezer. Then, a trained research staff member will draw a small sample of blood (2 x 9 mL vials) for glucose and genetic testing. 

After the blood draw, we will escort you to a cafe to eat breakfast. After breakfast, you will meet our research staff at the Health Discovery Building for more assessments. You will then undergo a series of cognitive tests (memory, attention, problem solving, etc.) and an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan. MRIs are non-invasive and use no radiation or dyes. 


## Mid-year check in visits
In between annual visits, we will check in with you during a brief mid-year visit (about 1 hour). During this mid-year check in visit, we will update any contact information and ask you to complete a few short surveys about how your life is changing. 

Each year for the three years following, you will come in for 2 assessment visits and 1 mid-year check-in visit.
